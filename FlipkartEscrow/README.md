#### Data Structures
```solidity
enum Status { Placed, Shipped, Delivered, Cancelled }

struct Order {
    address payable buyer;    // Order buyer address

### Deployment & Testing

#### Step 1: Setup
- Open [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
- Create folder: `FlipkartEscrow/`
- Add `FlipkartEscrow.sol` and paste the contract code

#### Step 2: Compile
- Go to Solidity Compiler
- Select compiler version `^0.8.20`
- Compile the contract

#### Step 3: Deploy

##### Ethereum Testnet (Sepolia/Goerli)
- Go to **Deploy & Run Transactions**
- Choose **Injected Provider - MetaMask**
- Connect to testnet
- Deploy contract (no constructor arguments)

##### Local Testing (JavaScript VM)
- Choose **JavaScript VM**
- Deploy contract directly

#### Step 4: Testing Workflow

1. **As Buyer:**
   ```solidity
   // Place order with 0.1 ETH
   placeOrder(sellerAddress, {value: 100000000000000000});
   
   // Check order status
   getOrderStatus(1); // Returns Status.Placed
   ```

2. **As Seller:**
   ```solidity
   // Mark order as shipped
   markAsShipped(1);
   
   // Verify status change
   getOrderStatus(1); // Returns Status.Shipped
   ```

3. **As Buyer (Delivery Confirmation):**
   ```solidity
   // Confirm delivery (releases funds to seller)
   confirmDelivery(1);
   
   // Check final status
   getOrderStatus(1); // Returns Status.Delivered
   ```

4. **As Buyer (Cancellation):**
   ```solidity
   // Cancel order (only before shipping)
   cancelOrder(1);
   
   // Check status
   getOrderStatus(1); // Returns Status.Cancelled
   ```

---

### Example Usage

```solidity
// Deploy contract
FlipkartEscrow escrow = new FlipkartEscrow();

// Buyer places order for 0.5 ETH
uint256 orderID = escrow.placeOrder{value: 0.5 ether}(sellerAddress);

// Seller ships the order
escrow.markAsShipped(orderID);

// Buyer confirms delivery
escrow.confirmDelivery(orderID);

// Check final status
Status finalStatus = escrow.getOrderStatus(orderID);
// finalStatus == Status.Delivered
```

### Transaction Flow

#### Successful Transaction
1. **Buyer** places order with payment â†’ Funds locked in escrow
2. **Seller** marks as shipped â†’ Status updated to "Shipped"
3. **Buyer** confirms delivery â†’ Funds released to seller
4. **Final Status**: Delivered

#### Cancelled Transaction
1. **Buyer** places order with payment â†’ Funds locked in escrow
2. **Buyer** cancels order (before shipping) â†’ Refund issued
3. **Final Status**: Cancelled

---

### Use Cases

#### E-commerce Platforms
- **Marketplace Protection**: Secure transactions between unknown parties
- **Buyer Protection**: Funds held until delivery confirmation
- **Seller Protection**: Payment guaranteed upon delivery
- **Dispute Resolution**: Clear status tracking for mediation

#### Business Applications
- **Freelance Services**: Escrow for service delivery
- **Digital Products**: Secure payment for downloads
- **Physical Goods**: Traditional e-commerce escrow
- **Subscription Services**: Recurring payment protection

---

### Security Considerations

- **Fund Security**: Funds locked in contract until delivery or cancellation
- **Access Control**: Only relevant parties can update order status
- **Status Validation**: Strict order status progression
- **Refund Protection**: Automatic refunds on cancellation
- **No Admin Control**: Decentralized system without central authority

---

### Integration Examples

#### Web3 Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Place order
const tx = await contract.placeOrder(sellerAddress, {
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther("0.1")
});

// Listen for order events
contract.on("OrderPlaced", (id, buyer, seller, amount) => {
    console.log(`Order ${id} placed: ${amount} ETH`);
});

// Check order status
const status = await contract.getOrderStatus(orderId);
const statusNames = ["Placed", "Shipped", "Delivered", "Cancelled"];
console.log(`Order status: ${statusNames[status]}`);
```

#### Event Monitoring
```javascript
// Monitor all order events
contract.on("OrderShipped", (id) => {
    console.log(`Order ${id} has been shipped`);
});

contract.on("OrderDelivered", (id) => {
    console.log(`Order ${id} delivered, payment released`);
});

contract.on("OrderCancelled", (id) => {
    console.log(`Order ${id} cancelled, refund issued`);
});
```

---

### Error Handling

Common error scenarios and solutions:

- **"Payment must be greater than zero"**: Send ETH with placeOrder transaction
- **"Only seller can mark shipped"**: Ensure seller address is calling markAsShipped
- **"Only buyer can confirm delivery"**: Ensure buyer address is calling confirmDelivery
- **"Order must be shipped first"**: Cannot confirm delivery before shipping
- **"Cannot cancel after shipping"**: Orders can only be cancelled before shipping
