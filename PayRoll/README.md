---

## Prerequisites

- MetaMask or QSafe (for testnet deployment)
- Testnet ETH or QRN
- Access to [QRemix IDE](https://qremix.org)
- Basic understanding of Solidity and access control

---

## Deployment & Testing on QRemix

### ðŸ”¹ Step 1: Setup
- Open [qremix.org](https://qremix.org)
- Create folder: `Payroll/`
- Add `Payroll.sol` and paste the contract code

### ðŸ”¹ Step 2: Compile
- Go to **Solidity Compiler**
- Select version **0.8.0** or later
- Compile the contract

### ðŸ”¹ Step 3: Deploy

#### Quranium Testnet
- Select **Injected Provider - MetaMask**
- Connect to Quranium testnet
- Deploy contract and set the manager

#### JavaScript VM
- Use **JavaScript VM**
- Deploy and test locally

### ðŸ”¹ Step 4: Testing

1. Call `setManager(managerAddress)` (only once)
2. From manager account, call `assignSalary(employeeAddress, amount)`
3. Send ETH to the contract via a simple transaction
4. Call `pay(employeeAddress)` from manager
5. Verify employee received ETH
