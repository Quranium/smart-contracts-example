# Smart Contract Examples - Quranium Blockchain 

This repository provides basic and advanced smart contract examples library for developers building on the Quranium chain — a post-quantum secure blockchain leveraging the SLHDSA signature scheme.

These contracts are provided as **educational references** to help you get started with Quranium development and deployment.

## ✍️ Signature Scheme

All smart contracts here are intended to be used with **SLHDSA**, Quranium’s native post-quantum signature standard.

Please ensure your deployment wallet, transaction signer, and infrastructure are compatible with SLHDSA. Use the Qafe browser extension or Quranium SDK for integration.
